                <h2>THE BIG CIGAR</h2>
                <h3>The Big Cigar, a new six-episode limited series executive produced and written by Jim Hecht ("Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty"), and executive produced and showrun by NAACP Image Award winner Janine Sherman Barrois ("Claws," "The Kings of Napa"), with Don Cheadle ("No Sudden Move," "Black Monday," "House of Lies") on board to direct and executive produce the first two episodes, based on the eponymous Playboy magazine article from Joshuah Bearman ("Argo"), who will also serve as executive producer. With Andre Holland ("The Eddy," "Moonlight") in discussions to star as Black Panther leader Huey P. Newton, The Big Cigar tells the extraordinary, hilarious, almost-too-good-to-be-true story of how Newton relied on his best friend, Bert Schneider, the Hollywood producer behind "Easy Rider," to elude a nationwide manhunt and escape to Cuba while being pursued into exile by the FBI.</h3>

                <h2>DEADBOY DETECTIVES</h2>
                <h3>From Emmy® nominee Steve Yockey (The Flight Attendant, Supernatural), Doom Patrol's Jeremy Carver and Berlanti Productions, the DC drama DEAD BOY DETECTIVES is a horror detective series born from DC's The Sandman and Dead Boy Detectives comics. It's a fresh take on a ghost story that explores loss, grief, and death through the lens of Edwin Payne and Charles Rowland, two dead British teenagers, and their very alive friend, Crystal Palace. So, it's a lot like a vintage detective series - only darker and on acid.</h3>

                <h2>ABBOTT ELEMENTARY</h2>
                <h3>In this workplace comedy, a group of dedicated, passionate teachers — and a slightly tone-deaf principal — are brought together in a Philadelphia public school where, despite the odds stacked against them, they are determined to help their students succeed in life. Though these incredible educators may be outnumbered and underfunded, they love what they do — even if they don’t love the school district’s less-than-stellar attitude toward educating children. In season 3, it’s a new year at Abbott Elementary, and Janine is as eager as ever. She plans a district-wide initiative – Career Day – and is anxious for it to be a success. Meanwhile, Ava has a new approach to her job, and Melissa is asked a surprising question</h3>
